## Hey, I'm Ben

I'm a systems focused game programmer currently finishing my B.S. in Game Programming at Champlain College (graduating May 2026). Who loves architecting new systems, optimizing existing ones, and learning new things

## What I Do

I specialize in gameplay systems, performance optimization, and building the foundational systems that make everyone's jobs easier. I've worked on everything from incremental OS simulators to flight sims with ML powered autopilots to echolocation shaders for horror games.


## Experience

I interned at the Leahy Center for Digital Forensics \& Cybersecurity, building .NET tools for government clients. It gave me a solid foundation in software engineering practices that I bring to every project.


## Currently

Right now I'm leading development on **FincrementalOS**, an incremental game where you manage a simulated OS to shoot as fish and become as rich as possible
