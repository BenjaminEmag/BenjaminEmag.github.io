## Overview

Fincremental is an incremental game where player shoots fish from their simulated operating system in a submarine, upgrading and progressing as they go. As part of my senior capstone project, I served as lead programmer on a team of 12, architecting the core systems that drive the gameplay experience.

## My Role

As Lead Programmer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the foundational architecture of the game. This included building the window management system, upgrade progression, and persistent save system. I also created a modular minigame framework that allowed designers to easily integrate new content without touching core code.

## Technical Details

The project follows SOLID principles throughout the codebase to ensure maintainability and extensibility as the team scales development. The architecture separates concerns between the OS simulation layer, UI systems, and individual minigame modules, allowing for speedy development.
