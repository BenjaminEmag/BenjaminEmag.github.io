## Overview

Moai Mayhem is an educational adventure game where players explore environments and collect Moai statues. Developed as a team project and published on Itch.io.

## My Role

I implemented the player movement system, focusing on tight integration with the rigged 2D character animations to create responsive, visually polished controls. I also designed the placement of collectible Moai statues throughout the game environments to encourage exploration.
