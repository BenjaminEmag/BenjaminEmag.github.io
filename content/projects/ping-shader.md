## Overview

P.I.N.G is a first-person horror game built in Unreal Engine 5 where players navigate environments using echolocation. As lead programmer on a team of 12, I developed the custom shader system that brings this unique mechanic to life.

## My Role

I designed and implemented the core echolocation visualization system, working closely with designers to tune visual parameters for optimal gameplay and readability. The shader needed to work seamlessly across all environment meshes while maintaining the eerie atmosphere of the horror setting.

## Technical Details

The echolocation shader uses UV-independent rendering, allowing it to be applied seamlessly to any mesh without requiring custom UV mapping. I also engineered a shadow masking system that excludes shadowed geometry from the visualization, creating a more realistic and immersive echolocation effect where sound waves realistically fail to reveal areas blocked from the source.
